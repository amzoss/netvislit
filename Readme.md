# Readme

This repository processes data for a research project on Network Visualization Literacy.

To skip to the analysis and results, see [Results](Command%20Files/Results/) files. (I hope to improve the readability of these files soon.)

I have given two presentations on this work:

* [IUNI Open Science Forum](Zoss-OpenScienceForum.pdf) (November 1, 2017)
* [Duke Visualization Friday Forum](Zoss-VFF-03-23-18.pdf) (March 23, 2018)
