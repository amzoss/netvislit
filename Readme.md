# Readme

This repository processes data for a research project on Network Visualization Literacy.

To skip to the analysis and results, see [Graphic Model Results](Command%20Files/Results/Graphic-Models-Main.md) and [Layout Model Results](Command%20Files/Results/Layout-Models-Main.md) files. (I hope to improve the readability of these files soon.)

I have given two presentations on this work:

* [IUNI Open Science Forum](Zoss-OpenScienceForum.pdf) (November 1, 2017)
* [Duke Visualization Friday Forum](Zoss-VFF-03-23-18.pdf) (March 23, 2018) (also see the [video](https://compsci.capture.duke.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1d52fa74-033d-48fc-b0d1-a3a86f12ffaa))

My public dissertation defense will be held on Tuesday, March 27, 2018 at Indiana University Bloomington. The [defense slides](Zoss-Defense-03-27-2019.pdf) are available.
