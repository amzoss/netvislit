# Readme File for Analysis of Student Pilot Data
*Angela Zoss*
*June 23, 2017*

See http://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/specifications/ for more information about the structure of this document.

The Read Me file consists of three main sections:

## The contents of the replication documentation

This section briefly describes all the files included in the replication documentation, and outlines the structure of the folders in which they are stored.

## Modifications made to importable data files (if necessary)

As explained above in the description of the Original Data folder, whenever an original data file is in a format that cannot be read by the software you are using, you need to create a second version, called an importable data file, that your software can read.

Section 2 of the Read Me file documents the changes you make to your importable data files.  For each original data file you have to modify, you should give a verbal explanation of all the changes you made to create the importable version.  That explanation should be written in complete and grammatically correct sentences; it should give the names of both the original and importable versions of the data file that was modified; and it should be precise enough to enable someone else to make the same changes to the original data file and end up with an importable data file identical to the one you created.

If all of your original data files are in formats that your software is able to read, so that it is not necessary to create importable versions of any of them, you may simply omit section 2 from the Read Me file.  (In that case, you should call the last section of the Read Me file section 2 instead of section 3.)

## Instructions for replicating the study

This section gives instructions for using the replication documentation to replicate the data processing and analysis conducted for the study and reproduce the reported results.

These instructions should:

* State what kinds of statistical software (including version number and required add-ons) are required to run the command files.
* Explain which files included in the replication documentation need to be copied onto the replicatorâ€™s computer, the structure of folders and sub-folders in which the files should be copied, and which of the folders each file should be saved in.
* Indicate which of the folders should be set as the working directory when the statistical software that executes the command files is run.
* Indicate the order in which the command files need to be run to carry out the replication.  And, for each command file, indicate what other files it uses (e.g., what data files it opens and what other command files it calls) and what output it produces (e.g., new data files it saves, old data files it deletes, and new directories it creates).## The contents of the replication documentation
